# Walkthrough
This sample demonstrates how to build and deploy ASP.NET Core microservice applications using a CI/CD pipeline that includes IaC deployment jobs with Terraform. The pipeline is designed for fully automated end-to-end integration testing with
high deployment speed and high branch concurrency.

- Managing the entire application lifecycle including infrastructure deployment, application build and installation, and automated testing with a single multi-job YAML pipeline.
- Building a very fast CI/CD pipeline through 

- ASP.NET Core modules and custom code for application observability, including exposing rich metrics to Application Insights or third-party tools.
